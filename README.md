# HoloApp

MATLAB App originally developed by Glenn Howe.

Commented (and hopefully optimised) by Lito Chatzidavari.

To use, open the HoloApp file.

You will need toset the geometry before you do anything.

By default, the 4 arts of a circular beam will be used.

More info to follow soon!


Things that need to get done:
	Acomodate for my screen :')
	Be able to control more beams
